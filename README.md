# Pointers-Basic
Instinctive learning of pointer basics for day to day learning and techincal interview.

We are known that interfacing with the functions in C++ is done using few methods, and the most prominent and well known are "Pass by Value" and "Pass by Reference".
But what it is like to use pointers as arguements and feeding them as the formal parameters to achieve the functions calls. Here in this first commit there few such ways demonstrated on how to pass parameters using pointers, as a reference, as a value.
This example should enrich one with the ability to understand how formal parameters should be hamdled while passing either a value, or a reference or a pointer. And it is believed this idea and basic instinct of understanding is a must.
